		<p>Bustle draws sequence diagrams of D-Bus activity.
		    It shows signal emissions, method calls and their
		    corresponding returns, with time stamps for each individual
		    event and the duration of each method call. This can help
		    you check for unwanted D-Bus traffic, and pinpoint why your
		    D-Bus-based application is not performing as well as you
		    like. It also provides statistics like signal frequencies
		    and average method call times.</p>

				<p>The raw sender and destination for each message is now shown in the details pane.</p>
				<p>Bytestrings with embedded NULs which are otherwise ASCII are now shown as ASCII strings.</p>

		<release date="2018-06-15" version="0.7.1">
			<description>
				<p>It's now possible to monitor the system bus (from the user interface and with the bustle-pcap command-line tool), with no need to reconfigure the system bus. It's also possible to monitor an arbitrary bus by address.</p>
				<p>Bustle now requires that dbus-monitor (≥ 1.9.10) and pkexec are installed on your system.</p>
